# SnapShot
JS used for snapshot Captures

Feel free to use my infura account, the scripts are pointing to the infura webaddress and my key.

SnapShot1, Snapshot2 and Snapshot3 are the scripts used to pull the addresses associated with each token.
The DDSapi.json, is just a file that contains the api for interacting with the DDS token contract.
